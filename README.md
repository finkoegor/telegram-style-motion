# Telegram Style Motion

Promo clips of an iOS app in the style Telegram uses for its feature announcements:
a real phone on a soft gradient, the app running inside, the camera leaning in on the
action, a ring pulsing under every tap.

The clip is one unbroken take. The app presses its own buttons on a timer, the
Simulator records the screen, a script puts the recording into a phone bezel, adds the
background, the camera moves and the rings, and encodes 60 fps H.264.

This repository is a skill for Claude Code: drop it into `~/.claude/skills/` or a
project's `.claude/skills/` and ask for "a promo clip of the add flow". It also works by
hand: the scripts are plain zsh, Python and Swift.

## What you need

- macOS with Xcode and the iOS Simulator
- ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- Python 3 with Pillow and numpy (`pip3 install pillow numpy`)
- a Debug build of your app on a simulator

## Quick start

1. Teach the app the flow. For SwiftUI, copy `templates/swiftui-autopilot/` into the app
   target, name the controls in `DemoTarget`, mark them with `.demoTarget(.name) { action }`
   and write the flow in `DemoAutopilot.run()`. Launched with `-Demo`, the app runs the
   flow and writes the timeline of presses. Nothing of this ships: it is all `#if DEBUG`.

2. Record a take:

   ```
   DARK=1 TIME=9:41 scripts/record.sh ~/takes/take1 <simulator udid> com.example.app -Demo
   ```

3. Build the clip:

   ```
   python3 scripts/compose.py ~/takes/take1 ~/takes/promo.mp4 --bezel bezel.png --camera auto
   ```

That is a square 1920 clip with the default gradient. Read on for the knobs.

## Your own flow

The scripts know nothing about your app; the flow is yours. Decide it first: one feature,
8 to 15 seconds, a numbered list of presses from the opening screen to the final one,
with what the viewer should read at each step. Then:

- name each pressed control in `DemoTarget` and mark it in the view with
  `.demoTarget(.name, isEnabled: ready, action: theSameAction)`; `isEnabled` makes the
  autopilot wait for loading instead of guessing delays;
- write the presses and pauses in `DemoAutopilot.run()` in the same order;
- seed inputs instead of typing them live: a link via the clipboard or a launch argument
  (`-DemoLink https://...`, read with `DemoAutopilot.argument("Link")`), photos in the
  simulator's library, typed text through the model in chunks;
- save the app state the clip should start from and restore it before every take
  (`STATE_DIR`);
- plan the camera from the same list: lean in where there is something to read, go wide
  before full-screen effects, end wide.

With Claude Code, describe the flow in words ("add an item from a link, show the cutout,
end on the board") and let the skill wire the targets and write the scenario.

## The phone

Pass `--bezel` with a PNG of a phone whose screen is transparent. The hole is found
automatically and scaled to the recording, so it only has to be the same device the
recording was made on (same aspect ratio).

- Best: Apple's Product Bezels (developer.apple.com/design/resources). Real materials,
  buttons and highlights. Pick the device and color you like and pass the portrait PNG.
- Any other mockup PNG with a transparent screen works the same way, attach it as a file.
- With Xcode installed, `swift scripts/chrome.swift "iPhone 17 Pro" bezel.png` renders
  the Simulator's own chrome: exact, but flat.
- Without `--bezel` a plain dark body is drawn.

The screen's own corners stay square in the recording; the bezel's hole shape hides them.
The Dynamic Island is in the recording already.

## The background

- `--background gradient` with `--colors "#c9b8ff,#ffc9a8,#9fd8ff,#ffb3d1"`: a soft mesh
  of up to eight colors. Put the brand palette here.
- `--background "#111112"`: a solid color.
- `--background art.png`: any image, cropped to cover the frame.

The background follows the camera at a quarter of its pace, which gives the parallax.

## The camera

- `--camera none`: a steady wide shot.
- `--camera auto`: leans in at every press and back out after.
- `--camera moves.json`: your own moves. Each move has `at` (seconds, or `tap2-0.4` for
  0.4 s before the second press), `zoom`, `focus` in screen points and `duration`:

  ```json
  [
    { "at": "tap2-0.45", "duration": 1.0, "zoom": 1.55, "focus": [201, 380] },
    { "at": "tap3-0.95", "duration": 0.8, "zoom": 1.0 }
  ]
  ```

  Lean in on details (a form, a picture being processed), go wide before an effect that
  needs the whole screen, end wide.

## The rings

`--ring grey` (default) is a grey ring with a white rim and a soft shadow; it stays
visible over white buttons. `--ring white` is the plain white ring from Telegram's clips.
`--ring none` turns them off. `--ring-radius` is in screen points.

## Formats

`--size 1920x1920` for a square post, `1080x1350` for a 4:5 feed, `1080x1920` for Reels
and Stories. `--share` is how much of the frame height the phone takes (0.86).
`--lead` and `--tail` set the rest before the first press and after the last one.

## Sync

The timeline counts from the app's start, the recording from the recorder's. The script
lines them up itself: after a press the screen changes, so it finds the offset that puts
every press a frame before a change. If the flow has a spinner running before the first
press, or the timeline was written by hand, pass `--offset` in seconds yourself.

## Without touching the app

Drive the flow with `xcrun simctl` or any simulator automation, write `taps.json` by hand
with times measured from the start of the recording, and pass `--offset 0`. The autopilot
is better: external taps drift, and the first taps after a boot land late.

## Tips

- Start every take from the same app state: `STATE_DIR` restores a saved copy of the
  app's Application Support folder.
- Let the app launch once after the simulator boots and wait 10 seconds before the take.
- A paste button needs text on the simulator clipboard: `CLIPBOARD="..."`.
- For a seamless loop, end the flow on the screen it started from and trim the tail.
- Check the clip frame by frame before posting:
  `ffmpeg -i promo.mp4 -vf "fps=2,scale=240:-1,tile=6x4" -frames:v 1 sheet.png`

## По-русски

Скилл для Claude Code и три скрипта, чтобы снимать промо-ролики iOS-приложения в
стиле Telegram: телефон на градиенте, приложение внутри, камера наезжает на действие,
кольцо под каждым тапом. Сценарий у каждого свой: описываешь флоу словами (с какого
экрана, какие нажатия, чем заканчивается), скилл помечает нужные кнопки в коде и
пишет сценарий, приложение само нажимает их по таймеру (шаблон для SwiftUI в
`templates/`), симулятор пишет экран (`scripts/record.sh`), скрипт собирает ролик
(`scripts/compose.py`). Рамка телефона: Product Bezels с сайта Apple или любой
свой PNG с прозрачным экраном через `--bezel`; фон: фирменный градиент через
`--colors`, цвет или картинка через `--background`; камера `--camera auto` или свой
JSON; формат `--size`. Подробности выше.
